//Sprint 3 Backlog
November 4th to November 10th


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to be able to write to and read files in order to store data
b) As a user, I want to be able to have easy access to other important directories in order to work more effciently
c) As a user, I want to receive a message if my command was not valid, so I know that what not to do in the future
d) As a developer, I want to make a new directory within another directory so that I can organize my files better.	
e) As a developer, I want to be able to see the contents of my current directory so that I can check if it contains the file I am looking for.
f)As a developer, I want to see which directory I'm currently in, so that I know where I am in my computer's file system right now.
g)As a developer, I want to see the previous commands I used, so that I can quickly check what I previously entered without scrolling up the shell.

Specific tasks to be accomplished: 
* (Design) Continue reviewing the CRC cards and agreeing on a single design 

a-1. (cat) Finish implementing cat so that files can be read
a-2. (Echo) Finish implementing echo s.t. we can write to files by overwriting
a-3. (Echo) Finish implementing echo s.t. we can write to files by appending
b-1. (cd) Implementing cd s.t. we can switch directories within the shell

g-3. (popd) Finish implementing so we can access the stored directories
