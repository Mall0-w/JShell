//Sprint 2 Backlog
October 28th to November 3rd


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to search for directories by their path, so that I can open a different file.
b) As a user, I want to be able to write to and read files in order to store data
c) As a user, I want to be able to have easy access to other important directories in order to work more effciently
d) As a user, I want to be able to see documentation of the shell so i know how to properly use it
e) As a user, I want to receive a message if my command was not valid, so I know that what not to do in the future
f) As a developer, I want to make a new directory within another directory so that I can organize my files better.	
g) As a developer, I want to be able to see the contents of my current directory so that I can check if it contains the file I am looking for.
h)As a developer, I want to see which directory I'm currently in, so that I know where I am in my computer's file system right now.
i)As a developer, I want to see the previous commands I used, so that I can quickly check what I previously entered without scrolling up the shell.
